INSTALL NOTES:

Required:
1) Build pynids (nids) from ./depends/pynids-0.6.1/.
    (new versions are released at http://jon.oberheide.org/pynids/)
	To compile pynids, you need the following ubuntu packages:
	pkg-config python-dev libgtk2.0-dev libnet1-dev

	from ./depends/pynids-0.6.1/ directory
	$ python setup.py build
	$ python setup.py install

2) Build SpiderMonkey 'js' from ./depends/js-1.8.0-rc1-src/.
    (new versions are released at http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/js/)

    This package has modifications to the spidermonkey source code; therefore, it is not recommended you use default smjs packages. (Details of the modifications are in INSTALL.spidermonkey.shellcode and INSTALL.spidermonkey, for historical purposes)

    from ./depends/js-1.8.0-rc1-src/ directory
    $ make BUILD_OPT=1 -f Makefile.ref
    Then, make the 'js' binary available within your path.

3) Build YARA (detection library) from ./depends/yara-1.4/
    (new versions are released at http://code.google.com/p/yara-project/downloads/list)
    (For Ubuntu or other systems, these packages may be required: libpcre3 libpcre3-dev)

	For Ubuntu or other systems, you may need to add the following path after building:

	$ sudo echo "/usr/local/lib" >> /etc/ld.so.conf
	$ sudo ldconfig
4) Build YARA Python from ./depends/yara-python-1.4/
    (new versions are released at http://code.google.com/p/yara-project/downloads/list)
