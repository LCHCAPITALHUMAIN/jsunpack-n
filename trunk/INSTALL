INSTALL NOTES:

Required:
1) Get pynids (nids) from http://jon.oberheide.org/projects/pynids/downloads/pynids-0.5a.tar.gz (make sure you get this one and not the older one)
	To compile pynids, you need the following ubuntu packages:
	pkg-config python-dev libgtk2.0-dev libnet1-dev

	from ./pynids-0.5a/
	$ python setup.py build
	$ python setup.py install

2) Get SpiderMonkey JS, you must have 'js' binary in your path
	You can either install the spidermonkey-bin package or compile from source
	1) http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/js/ (prefer js-1.7.0.tar.gz or greater)

	There are many advantages to modifying the spidermonkey source code, for instructions please read INSTALL.spidermonkey and INSTALL.spidermonkey.shellcode

3) Get YARA (detection library), you must use YARA 1.3 (or greater) from http://code.google.com/p/yara-project/downloads/list

    (For Ubuntu or other systems, these packages may be required: libpcre3 libpcre3-dev)

    $ wget http://yara-project.googlecode.com/files/yara-1.3.tar.gz
    $ wget http://yara-project.googlecode.com/files/yara-python-1.3.tar.gz

    Additionally, on my system the directory /usr/share/libtool/config/ did not exist. Therefore, I had to download libtool, compile it, then create a symbolic link:

    $ wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/libtool/libtool-2.2.tar.gz
    build it, then:

    $ sudo ln -s /usr/local/share/libtool/ /usr/share/libtool

	build both yara and yara-python
	For Ubuntu or other systems, you may need to add the following path:

	$ sudo echo "/usr/local/lib" >> /etc/ld.so.conf
	$ sudo ldconfig


4) BeautifulSoup from http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/#Download


Optional:
a) To use the -g --graph option, you should install the "python-yapgvb" package.

b) Debugging/profiling: Heapy from http://guppy-pe.sourceforge.net/#Heapy

c) Filetype identification: Magic (optional)
